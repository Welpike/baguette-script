# Welcome to the baguette-script documentation

Baguette-script is a new programming language. It's a _hyperscript brother, the first version was a clone of the version 0.9.8 of _hyperscript.

The core principles are same so for all aspects not present in this documentation, check out [_hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org)'s.

Baguette-script provides a better ecosystem for plugins than _hyperscript.
