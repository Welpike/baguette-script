# baguette-script

Baguette-script is a new programming language. It's a _hyperscript brother, the first version was a clone of the version 0.9.8 of _hyperscript.

The core principles are same so for all aspects not present in this documentation, check out _hyperscript's.

Baguette-script aims to offer a better ecosystem for plugins than _hyperscript.
